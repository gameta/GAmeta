<h3> Tolerance Map for statistical and worst Case tolerance analysis</h3>
<p>A probability model for conducting statistical tolerance analysis and allocation is
put forth in this dissertation. The model utilizes the ASU T-Maps model for geometric
tolerances to build the frequency distribution for a dimension of interest in an assembly
of parts. The central element of the ASU T-Maps model is the Tolerance-Map(T-Map);
it is the range of points resulting from a one-to-one mapping from all the
variational possibilities arising from the manufacture of a feature, within its tolerance-
zone, to a specially designed Euclidean point-space. A functional T-Map represents both
the acceptable range of one-dimensional dimension of interest and the acceptable limits
to the three-dimensional variational possibilities of the target feature consistent with it.
An accumulation T-Map represents all the accumulated three-dimensional variational
possibilities of the target feature which arise from allowable variations on the individual
parts in the assembly. The geometry of the target feature and a specific value of the
dimension of interest are used to establish a functional surface that intersects the
accumulation T-Map. The common points to the geometric shapes of the accumulation T-
Map and the functional surface provide a measure of all variational possibilities of
manufacture of the parts, which will give the specific value of the dimension of interest.
By choosing many values of the dimension of interest, the measures are then arranged as
a probability density function.</p>
<p>Since, the ASU Tolerance-Map model is in conformance with alternate and
supplemental specifications for tolerances in the ASME Y14.5 standard, the probability
model also gives distinct results for each alternative and added refinement. The
probability model from T-Maps presented in this thesis builds the probability
distributions from the geometric bias of the tolerance zone and measurement type, while
assuming equal likelihood of manufacturing biases. If consistent experimental data are
available correlating the manufacturing biases to the position, orientation and form of a
feature, these manufacturing biases can be included as weights when constructing the
frequency distributions.</p>
<p>The probability model is applied to several assemblies that contain planar
features, an engaged pin and hole, an engaged tab and slot, a feature-cluster, and patterns
of features. The results are compared with those from Monte Carlo simulations in
commercial software.</p>
<p>Implementation for worst case analysis dealt with (a) T-Map creation, (b) T-Map conformation for target, (c) T-Map accumulation, (d) T-Map fitting to function, (e) Compute sensitivity and allocate tolerances.</p>
<p>Implementation for statistical analysis dealt with (a) Manufacturing distribution/bias selection, (b) T-Map conformation for target, (c) T-Map convolution using bias distributions, (d) S- surface computation based on inspection function, (e) Computing surface area of intersection of S- surface and Convolved T-Map for a given value of dimension of interest, and (f) building frequency distribution by varying the value of dimension of interest.</p>
<p>Implementation was done in modular fashion so that the front end could be OpenGL based or ACIS based.</p>
<p>Below are shown two demo's with OpenGL front end. First one shows creating T-Maps and conforming manually. The second one shows using CTF file (special ACIS/ASU tolerance constraint feature graph file) to load tolerance and use the testbed to conduct tolerance analysis</p>

    <h3 id="SibsonsInterpolant"> Sibson's Interpolant</h3>
			<p>CAGD Projects: Sibson's Interpolant:
			Sibson's Interpolant is mainly used in multivariate data interpolation. Here we have used it to model a terrain, where x,y,z data of some location is available. The idea is to basically triangulate the input points in the x,y plane. </p>
			<p>Then generate the voronoi diagram. The next step is to simulate an insertion of point. Due to the insertion of this point P, the neighboring area of the voronoi polygons is effected.</p>
			<img src="Sibson's1.jpg" width="300">
					<img src="Sibson's2.jpg" width="300">

			<p>Therefore, barycentric combination of these affected area and their z coordinates are used to generate the z value for the new insertion point. i.e. Pz = Sum(Zi*AREAi(reduced)/Parea, i = 0...n). Note that the point is not actually inserted but only simulated. Therefore, the original voronoi polygons remain unchanged. </p>

			<p>Similarly, points are simulated for the whole domain. Few examples with the interpolated terrain and triangulation are shown. The above scheme describes the linear interpolant. A C1 interpolant is supposed to be better. Please refer http://dilbert.engr.ucdavis.edu/~suku/nem/ for further applications.</p>

  	<h3 id="BezierSimplex"> Bezier Simplex</h3>
  			<p>CAGD Projects: Bezier Hyper-Tetrahedrons (4D): The concept of Bezier Tetrahedrons is an extension of bezier triangles. It basically uses barycentric coordinates to compute points. Here we are using 4D input to interpolate a Bezier 4D tetrahedron (simplex). Linear and Least square approximation will be used. Three of the parameters are x,y, z coordinates. The fourth parameter is the temperature distribution in the space. The input is shown in the first figure. The size of the sphere represents the magnitude of the temperature at that location. The input space is kept tetrahedral to make matter complicate. The linear and least squares out is shown in the following figures. Surprisingly, the least squares generates negative temperatures (spheres of different color) for some of the points.<p>

	<h3 id="Hodograph"> Hodograph</h3>
			<p>CAGD Projects: Hodograph: Hodographs are polar velocity diagrams represented by a series of basis vectors. These can be used to develop bezier curve, if each basis vector is part of control polygon when attached end to end. The degree of the bezier curve is represented by the number of input basis vectors.</p>
			<p>Hodographs are used in tool path generation and plotting wind velocity. While plotting wind velocities, the velocity vectors become the basis vector for a hodograph.</p>

			<p>Since hodographs are represented by velocity vector, the velocity vector might change in direction or magnitude or both. The first figure shown when only the direction is changed, while the second and third include change in direction and magnitude.</p>
			<p>The Premise to this project was from a paper that says "if a vector is transformed succesively using transforms such as scale, rotate, translate (but not reflect), then the resultant bezier curve will be atleast C2 continuous".</p>

	<h3 id="Blossoms"> Blossoms</h3>
			<p>CAGD Projects: Blossoms: Given any control polygon, a new function is defined with number of parameters same as the degree of the curve. The points on the bezier curve can be evaluated when all the parameters are same and within the range 0-1. The range of all curves represented by this new function are called blossoms of the bezier curve. For a quadratic curve (degree two), the a blossom surface (two parameter) can be formed representing all the blossoms. For a cubic curve (degree three), a blossom volume can be formed representing all the blossom for the bezier curve.</p>
			<img src="Blossom2.jpg" width="600">

			<p>Blossoms are used in fast subdivision of a bezier curve while using DeCasteljau algorithm. Blossoms have also been used in Graph Matching algorithms as blossoms are subset of the original Graph(Bezier Curve in CAGD).</p>

			  <p>CAGD Projects: Coons Patches and Reflection Lines: A coons patch tries to approximate the shape of the surface based on just the boundry curves (u=0, u=1, v=0 and v=1). The basic idea is to generate the points of the control polygon from the boundry control polygon. This requires a measure of goodness of the shape of the surface. While the standard Coon's algorithm is efficient various other algorithms are also proposed in the literature based on the permanence and modified permanence. An implementation of these algorithms was accomplished. Few examples are shown. The second part of the project involved generating reflection lines. The boundry curves for a mercedes fender was provided with the location of the lights and view direction. The resultant reflection lines on the surface were rendered in a post script file.</p>

Although degree and number of control points are linked but we might want two bezier curve from 9 CP of degree 4 (each with 5 CP and one common point for C0 continuity). Bezier curves are constructed using the DeCasteljau algorithm. Its easier to debug and visualize if the results at each step are correct. The resultant curve is also shown.</p>
				<img src="untitled1.jpg" width="600">
			  <p>The next figure shows multiple curves. Curve editing, by moving control point (see next figure), or by deleting a whole curve is also implemented. Curves can be translated or rotated. The purpose of the editing tool is create a meaningful shape by combining several curves. A conceptual shape of the car is created as the final task for the project.</p>
				<img src="untitled3.jpg" width="300"><img src="untitled4.jpg" width="300">
			  <p>Once a desirable shape is created, it can be store as a PostScript file. (Viewable with GSviewer). The control points can also be saved as separate text file so as to open and edit later using the same program.</p>

	<h3 id="Delaunay">Delaunay Triangulation and Voronoi</h3>
			  <p>Delaunay Triangulation of a simple point data. Point data can be added as x, y values or by click on the screen. A list of x, y values can be read from a text file also. The triangulation is built by adding each point one at a time. A virtual triangle of large proportions is added first so that any point added lies atleast within the virtual triangle. The virtual triangle or any edges connecting to the vertices of the virtual triangle are not displayed.
			  </p>
			  <img src="Delaunay.jpg" width="600">

			  <p>Convex hull of the point data.
			  Each triangle's edge is queried for its neighbor having a vertex as the vertex of the virtual triangle. The edge across which such neighbor exists is the edge belonging to the convex hull.
			  </p>
			  <img src="Convex Hull.jpg" width="600">



			  <p>A helpful tool to identify the neighbor of each triangle. This is helpful when debugging the code.</p>
			   <img src="Query Triangle.jpg" width="600">

			  <p>Voronoi diagram of the triangulation. Voronoi diagrams are the dual to the delaunay triangulation. Voronoi diagram can be obtained by connecting the circumcenter (center of the circumcircle) of each triangle to its neighbor's circumcenter. Voronoi diagrams have various uses in path planning but is also used in identifying the location of a mobile phone. Each polygon in the voronoi diagram represents the range served by each mobile tower. The location of the tower is the small circle (see fig.) in the voronoi polygon (vertex of delaunay triangulation).</p>

			  <p>The adjacent figure shows an application of triangulation to create a triangular mesh, to be used in Finite Element Analysis. The respective Voronoi diagram is also displayed.</p>

		<h3 id="SmoothAnimations"> Fly through Smooth Animations using Keyframe</h3>
				<p>In this project, visual animation of flythrough was developed by first capturing keyframes around an object using camera's postion and orientation. The six parameters are then used in interpolation using linear BSpline and C2 continuous BSpline under euler angles and quaternions.</p>
					<img src="Animate.jpg" width="600">
				<p>The keyframes are shown as vertices of a 3d edges as shown below. The computed BSpline and its control point can also be visualized. The animation can be done by moving the camera along the interpolated coordinates or moving another object.</p>
